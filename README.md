By the Light of a Dying Sun
===========================

This is an indie game I'm working on. It's going to be a 2d puzzle-platformer (wow so original! Yeah it will be original so shut up) with an emphasis on the interplay of light and shadow. The game will be written in C++ using [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org) for the graphics framework. As time goes on, this file will expand to detail more about the project.

Please note that this code is not open source. If you found this repo, you're free to poke and prod for your own personal use only. Any commercial application that is not expressly permitted by me is prohibited, except for the portions of the code that were open source to begin with. I'll get a more official license soon.
